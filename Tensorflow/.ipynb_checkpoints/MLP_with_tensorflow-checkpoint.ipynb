    "According to TensorFlow's official website, “TensorFlow is an open source software library for numerical computation using dataflow graphs. Nodes in the graph represents mathematical operations, while graph edges represent multi-dimensional data arrays (aka tensors) communicated between them. The flexible architecture allows us to deploy computation to one or more CPUs or GPUs in a desktop, server, or mobile device with a single API.”"

    "It’s easy to classify TensorFlow as a neural network library, but it’s not just that. Yes, it was designed to be a powerful neural network library. But it has the power to do much more than that. We can build other machine learning algorithms on it such as decision trees or k-Nearest Neighbors. We can literally do everything we normally would do in numpy! It’s aptly called “numpy on steroids” by the open-source community"
